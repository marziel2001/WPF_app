# WPF_app
This project uses **Windows Presentation Foundation** UI  
to let user do some basic operations on files like
- create file with possibility of adding RAHS attributes  
- delete file or whole directory  

It also enables user to preview text files in the side panel.  

Another minor feature is a display of RAHS attributes of  
the selected file on the bottom status bar
